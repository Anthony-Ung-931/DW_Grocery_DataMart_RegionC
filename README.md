Directories are organized as follows:
- `0_SD_Team_*`
  - This contains the starting data for each of the teams involved.
  - WARNING: The databases are targeted by the `.gitignore` file.  
  &emsp;because the database files are so large.  
  You will need to download the databases from the drive folder  
  &emsp;and place into the respective folders.

- `1_Profiling`
  - Has everything needed to do the profiling for Deliverable 1.
